        <br>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. The game features an open-world environment and action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching, and uses gacha game monetization for players to obtain new characters, weapons, and other resources.</p>
        <p>Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to an element and ruled by a god associated with it. The story follows a twin (either male or female), referred to as the Traveler, who has traveled across many worlds with their twin but has become separated from them by an unknown god in Teyvat. The Traveler travels across Teyvat in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of the other nations, gods, and the world.</p>

                <h3>Sayu</h3>
                <p>"Are you in a hurry to find Sayu? She is usually hiding in the trees in the afternoons. I have my own ways of finding her, so let me know if you need help" <br>Kamisato Ayaka</p>
                <br>
                <p>Height has never been one of Sayu's strengths... She stopped growing a long time ago, long enough that she feels like she is trapped in a dream where time has stopped.<br>Sayu firmly believes that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller. In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.</p>

                <p>"A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind - sometimes sings songs as old as the hills, and other times sings poems fresh and new. Likes apples and lively places but is not a fan of cheese or anything sticky. When using his Anemo power to control the wind, it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that which appears light and breezy." <br>-Description from Official Website</p>
